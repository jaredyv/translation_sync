Article:200927468,"<h1>Importing Users</h1>
<hr>
<p>The default page upon clicking into the Import tab allows you to import users into your school.</p>
<h3>Step 1—Select File</h3>
<p>The XLS or CSV file for import must contain the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">First Name</li>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Last Name</li>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Username or E-mail address</li>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">User Unique ID</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Note</strong>: Please reference Edit Users- Unique ID.</p>
<p>If you do not include passwords in the file, Schoology will 
automatically generate a password for the user. As a System Admin, you 
can view the password in Edit Users once the import is complete.</p>
<p>If you’d like a way to more easily manage groups of students in the 
system, we recommend including the Grade Year column in the file. 
Including this column will allow you to associate users with a 
particular graduation year, which you may export and filter as needed 
for following school years.</p>
<h4>School Building<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;""><br></strong></h4>
<p>If there is more than one school in your Schoology account (E.g. 
Schoology District, Schoology High School, Schoology Middle School), 
you’ll see a field for School Building, into which you may import users.
 If you do not see this field in your import area, you may ignore this 
section.</p>
<p>The school building designated in this field will enroll users in 
your file in the selected school. Alternatively, you may add a “School 
Building” column in your file to enroll users in a particular school 
building by using the code listed in the option, “Listed in import 
file.”</p>
<h4>Select Role</h4>
<p>The role designated in this field will associate users in your file 
to the selected role. Alternatively, you may add a Role column to your 
file to associate users with a particular role by using the code listed 
in the option, Use Import File.</p>
<p><strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Note</strong>:
 With an Enterprise account you can add custom roles. To add additional 
roles to your school, please refer to Edit Users&gt;Roles.</p>
<p><img title=""Image: /attachments/token/incrxorxnarl77c/?name=Import+User+File.png"" src=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/attachments/token/incrxorxnarl77c/?name=Import+User+File.png"" alt=""Import User File.png"" height=""109"" width=""550""></p>
<h4>Email Conflicts</h4>
<p>User accounts with e-mail addresses must have a unique e-mail 
address. For example, if john@schoology.com exists in School 1, this 
same email address cannot be associated with a user account in School 2.
 In the case that a user has created an account using an e-mail address 
listed in your file, you must decide how you’d like Schoology to handle 
account-creation. You have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Don’t
 allow duplicates—If john@schoology.com already exists in the system 
(either at your school, or as an individual account), selecting this 
option will not create another account in Schoology.</li>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Create
 account with Username—If jsmith@gmail.com already exists in the system 
(either at your school, or at another school), selecting this option 
will create an account with the e-mail prefix, “jsmith” as the username.
 If your XLS or CSV file already specifies a username (e.g. johnsmith), 
an account will be created using the specified username.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Select File</h4>
<p>Please select the XLS or CSV file that contains the user information 
for import. This file usually comes from your organization’s database.</p>
<h4>Send activation email</h4>
<p>Selecting this option will send login instructions to users created with an email address.</p>
<h4>Update existing records</h4>
<p>Selecting this option will locate existing users by User Unique ID 
and update new information from the XLS or CSV file. Importing an empty 
column will not remove information from Schoology. For example, if you 
import a file with no Grad Year information, the update will not remove 
existing Grad Year information from Schoology.</p>
<h3>Step 2—Match Columns</h3>
<p>In the second step of the import process, you can match the 
information listed in each column to create a user account in Schoology.</p>
<ol>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">If
 the first row of your XLS or CSV file contains headers, please select 
the First Row is Headers option for a more streamlined importing 
experience.</li>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Match each Schoology Field to a column in the XLS or CSV file.</li>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Once each field is matched to the appropriate column, click Preview for an overview of new users.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3—Preview/Confirm</h3>
<p>New users will be indicated by an orange label, new. If you see a 
yellow message at the top of the screen, please note the message in 
relation to the options you had chosen in Step 1 of the import process,

<p>The third tab upon clicking into the Import area allows you to provision users into courses at your school.</p>
<h3>Step 1—Select file</h3>
<p>The XLS or CSV file for import must contain the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Course Code</li>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Section Code/Section School Code<br></li>
<li style=""margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">User Unique ID</li>
</ul>
<p>For a successful import, please make sure the courses in your school 
have both a course code and a section code/section school code. Please 
also make sure that users in your school have a User Unique ID.</p>
<p><strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Tip:</strong>&nbsp;You
 may export a CSV of course sections from the Export area for a list of 
courses in your school with both a course code and section code/section 
school code.</p>
<h4>Enrollment Type</h4>
<p>The enrollment type designated in this field will determine whether 
the user is a member of a course (student), or an admin of a course 
(teacher). Alternatively, you may add an Enrollment Type column to your 
file to associate users to a particular enrollment type by using the 
code listed in the option, Use import file.</p>

<p>Please select the grading period(s) with which the course sections listed in the import file are associated.</p>
<p><strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Tip</strong>:
 You may export a CSV of course sections from the Export area for a list
 of courses associated with a particular grading period. Please note 
that users are enrolled in course sections, and course sections are 
associated with grading periods. If a section is associated with 
multiple grading periods, enrolling a user in that section will enroll 
that user in all grading periods associated with the section. To create 
unique rosters by grading period(s), please create course sections 
associated with appropriate grading periods. See Importing Courses above
 for more information.</p>
<h4>Clear Existing Enrollments Before Import</h4>
<p>Selecting this option will locate existing course sections by Course 
Code and Section Code/Section School Code, clear existing enrollment in 
the course, and replace admin and members with users from the XLS or CSV
 file. Adding the same user back into the course will restore content 
created by that user in the course.</p>
<p><strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">Tip</strong>:
 To clear only the teacher in the course, import a file for the 
Enrollment Type, Admin. To clear only the students of the course, import
 a file for the Enrollment Type, Member.</p>
<h4>Select File</h4>
<p>Please select the XLS or CSV file that contains the enrollment information for import.</p>
<h3>Step 2—Match Columns</h3>
<p>In the second step of the import process, you can match the 
information listed in each column to provision users into course

<h1>Grading Scales</h1>
<hr />
<p>System administrators can create percentage and point-based grading scales that will immediately appear in every course in your school or organization. This feature provides a simpler way to establish system-wide consistency.</p>
<h4>Create system-wide grading scales</h4>
<p>To create a system-wide grading scale, follow these steps:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This grade scale will appear in the <a title=""Gradebook (Teachers)"" href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001903-Courses-Gradebook#grade_setup"">Grade Setup</a> area of all courses in the school or organization.</p>
<h4>Edit or delete grading scales</h4>
<p>You may edit or delete grading scales from the gear to the right of each grading scale. Editing a grading scale from the Grading Scales area of the system will affect the grading scale in courses where it's currently used. To create a new grading scale without affecting courses, we recommend creating a new grading scale.</p>
<p>Once a grading scale is associated with a graded item in a course, you cannot delete the grading scale until all associations have been removed.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>The Learning Objectives area allows you to create and organize learning objectives for your school or organization. In general, there are three areas in which learning objectives can be created: System Settings, <a title=""Resource Center (Teachers)"" href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001923-Resource-Center"">Personal Resources, and Group Resources</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend adjusting your <a title=""Permissions (Enterprise)"" href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001033-Edit-Users-Permissions-Enterprise-"">Permissions </a>to determine which roles in your system can create personal and group learning objectives. The permission that governs this ability is housed in the permission to Edit learning objectives.</p>
<h3>System Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>The Learning Objectives created in the System Settings area will be available to all teachers at your school. We recommend organizing your learning objectives into a folder structure, similar to that which you see for Common Core and State alignments.</p>

Article:201001143,"<h1>Overview</h1>
<hr>
<p>Due to an PowerSchool API issue, some schools may experience an issue where some sections from PowerSchool are not created in Schoology while using the <a title=""PowerSchool Integration (Enterprise)"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001073-PowerSchool-Integration-Enterprise-"">PowerSchool app</a>. <strong>Pearson has reported a resolution to the issue in version 7.9</strong>, which should be released late September 2013.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we would like to help you create the missing sections at your school. Since each section must be mapped to PowerSchool, we'll need to work together to get all of your sections uploaded into Schoology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What are the steps?</h1>
<hr><ol>
<li>If you'd like to create these sections before Pearson's release of the resolution, please <a title=""Submit a ticket"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"">submit a ticket</a> to our Help Desk with a file of Sections export attached to the ticket.</li>
<li>Once we receive this information, we'll create a CSV file that includes a School Section Code that matches missing sections to PowerSchool, and upload the missing sections into your school. We'll also pull the primary teacher account and students enrolled in this course from PowerSchool. The Support Team will keep you updated on our progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How do I export from PowerSchool?</h1>

<h1>Important Notes</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>If you make enrollment changes for this particular course in PowerSchool, the enrollment changes <strong>will not</strong> be updated in Schoology. System Admin or teachers must make manual enrollment changes for this course. Other courses that have been created through the PowerSchool app will be correctly updated with changes in PowerSchool.</li>
<li>Graded items and grades added to this course should sync with the PowerSchool gradebook if ""Live Sync Schoology Grades with PowerSchool"" is turned on at your school.</li>
<li>Once PowerSchool resolves the issue and your school upgrades to 7.9, this course will naturally sync with PowerSchool. You do not need to make any additional changes.</li>
<li>This import is a one-time resolution to get you started with the Sections you need, but you'll need to upgrade to PowerSchool version 7.9 in order to bring in Sections if this issue continues next term or next school year.</li>

courses must be associated to a different set of grading periods, please
 perform multiple imports to best accomplish your goals. For example, if
 “English: Period 1” in Grading Period 1 has a different roster of users
 than “English: Period 1” in Grading Period 2, there should be two 
sections called “Period 1” associated with different grading periods. 
This example requires two imports. If the roster of users in English: 
Period 1 is the same for Grading Period 1 and 2, there should be one 
section called “Period 1.” This example requires one import.</p>
<h4>Select File</h4>
<p>Please select the XLS or CSV file that contains the course information for import.</p>
<h4>Update existing records</h4>
<p>Selecting this option will locate existing course sections by Course 
Code and Section Code/Section School Code, and update new information 
from the XLS or CSV file. Importing an empty column will not remove 
information from Schoology. For example, if you import a file with no 
course description, the update will not remove existing course 
descriptions from Schoology.</p>

<hr>
<p>If your school or organization uses an&nbsp;SFTP server, or if you've used
 an automated import process with other systems, you can enable 
Schoology to automatically pull data from your SIS on a scheduled-basis.</p>
<h3>Step 1—&nbsp;File Setup</h3>
<h4>SFTP Configuration</h4>
<p>Enter the following information for your school or organization's SFTP server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host</li>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Port</li>
<li>Password</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the areas of configuration display the information required in the CSV file for import.</p>
<h4>Users</h4>
<p>Once you've entered the SFTP information above, you can begin mapping
 the information from your SIS to Schoology. Users are matched by school
 UID (unique identifier, e.g. student ID). Email addresses, school UIDs,
 and usernames must be unique, and each user must have a username or an 
email address (or both).&nbsp;The option to use the same SFTP as entered 
above is enabled by default. However, you may choose to use another SFTP
 server for each automated import.</p>
<ul>
<li>Path to File—&nbsp;You may choose to use a directory strategy, rather than a path to file to locate the CSV files for import.</li>
<li>Roles—&nbsp;Input the values from your&nbsp;import&nbsp;file that represents each role.</li>
<li>Buildings—&nbsp;Input the values from your import file that represents each school building.</li>
<li>Email Conflicts—&nbsp;In the case that a user has created an account 
using an email address listed in your file, you must decide how you'd 
like Schoology to handle account-creation.</li>
<ul>
<li>Don't allow duplicates- If&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:john@schoology.com"">john@schoology.com</a>&nbsp;already
 exists in the system (either at your school, or as an individual 
account), selecting this option will not create another account in 
Schoology.</li>
<li>Create account with Username- If&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:john@schoology.com"">john@schoology.com</a>&nbsp;already
 exists in the system (either at your school, or at another school), 
selecting this option will create an account with the email prefix, 
""john"" as the username.&nbsp; If your XLS or CSV file already specifies a 
username (e.g. johnsmith), an account will be created using the 
specified username.</li>
</ul>
<li>Import Frequency—&nbsp;Designate how often you'd like to import into Schoology.</li>
<li>Send Activation Email— If checked, users with a valid email address will receive an email with login instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;These values may be different for each school 
or organization, depending on the system from which you're importing 
information.</p>
<h4>Courses</h4>
<p>Existing courses (matched by course code) will be used if found. 
Section codes must be unique across courses and grading periods (e.g. a 
course with code ENG1 can only have one section with code 1a for grading
 period QTR1.&nbsp;The option to use the same SFTP as entered above is 
enabled by default. However, you may choose to use another SFTP server 
for each automated import.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Path to File—&nbsp;You may choose to use a directory strategy, rather than a path to file to locate the CSV files for import.</li>
<li>Grading Periods—&nbsp;Input the values from your import file that 
represents each grading period. Please note that in your CSV file for 
import, grading periods must be separated by piping.</li>
<li>Buildings—&nbsp;Input the values from your import file that represents each school building.</li>
<li>Import Frequency—&nbsp;Designate how often you'd like to import into Schoology.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Course Enrollment</h4>
<p>Courses are matched by course code, section code/section school code,
 and the selected grading period(s).&nbsp;The option to use the same SFTP as 
entered above is enabled by default. However, you may choose to use 
another SFTP server for each automated import.</p>
<ul>
<li>Path to File—&nbsp;You may choose to use a directory strategy, rather than a path to file to locate the CSV files for import.</li>
<li>Enrollment Type—&nbsp;Input the values that represent each enrollment type from your import file.</li>
<li>Grading Periods—&nbsp;Input the values from your import file that 
represents each grading period. Please note that in your CSV file for 
import, grading periods must be separated by piping.</li>
<li>Import Frequency—&nbsp;Designate how often you'd like to import into Schoology.</li>
<li>
<p>Clear enrollments not in file—&nbsp;Selecting this option will locate 
existing course sections by Course Code and Section Code/Section School 
Code, clear existing enrollment in the course, and replace admin and 
members with users from the CSV file. Adding the same user back into the
 course will restore content created by that user in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To clear only the teacher in the course, import
 a file for the Enrollment Type, Admin. To clear only the students of 
the course, import a file for the Enrollment Type, Member.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Parents</h4>
<p>Parent-student associations are built by mapping the parents Unique 
User ID to the childs Unique User ID in the CSV file.&nbsp;The option to use 
the same SFTP as entered above is enabled by default. However, you may 
choose to use another SFTP server for each automated import.</p>
<ul>
<li>Path to File—&nbsp;You may choose to use a directory strategy, rather than a path to file to locate the CSV files for import.</li>

Article:201001003,"<p>If your school has multiple buildings (e.g., Schoology High School, Schoology Middle School), you may have worked with Schoology to add an area for Schools. Before you add a school building, however, you should consider whether having mutliple buildings is the right solution for your framework.</p>
<h1>Responsibilities with School Buildings</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>User Provisioing</li>
<ul>
<li>As a System Administrator, you must manage account creation for multiple schools. For example, when you <a href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001013-Import-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Five-Tabs-Enterprise-"">import users</a> into Schoology, you must make sure users are provisioned into the correct school.</li>
</ul>
<li>Course Provisioning</li>
<ul>
<li>You must also manage course creation for multiple schools. For example, when you <a href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001013-Import-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Five-Tabs-Enterprise-"">import courses</a> into Schoology, you must make sure courses and sections are provisioned into the correct school.</li>
</ul>
<li>Enrollment Maintenence</li>
<ul>
<li>When students and teachers change their enrollment from one school building to another, you must <a href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201000913-Edit-Users-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Four-Tabs-Enterprise-#roles/advanced"">make these adjustments</a> in Schoology.</li>
</ul>
<li>Privacy Settings</li>
<ul>
<li>System Administrators must consider the <a href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201000953-System-Settings-Privacy-Overrides-Enterprise-"">privacy</a> settings for each school building. For example, should a teacher in one school be able to view the courses of teacher in another school? With the addition of school buildings, there are additional District Privacy Settings to help you establish these kinds of settings at your school.</li>
</ul>
<li>System Administrators at the school and building level</li>
<ul>
<li>It's also important to note that System Administrators associated with the parent organization or district (e.g., Schoology District) will have access to administer users and content in all school buildings.</li>
<li>However, System Administrators associated with a school building will only have access to administer the school building (e.g., Schoology High School). Therefore, while the <a href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001033-Edit-Users-Permissions-Enterprise-"">permission settings</a> for System Administrators may be the same for all users associated with the role, their school association may not provide the same access for all users.</li>
</ul>
<li>Support Contacts</li>
<ul>
<li><a href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001023-Support-Contacts-Enterprise-"">Support Contacts</a> may only be designated for the entire school. There cannot be support contacts established on a building-by-building basis.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once you add school buildings to your system, other areas of Schoology will be sorted by school building as well. These areas include the Course Listing, <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001053-School-Analytics-Enterprise-"">School Analytics</a>, <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201000913-Edit-Users-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Four-Tabs-Enterprise-"">Edit Users</a>, and the area to <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001953-Courses-Add-Members-to-Courses"">add members</a> to courses and groups.</p>
<p>If you decide that school buildings are the best framework for your school or organization, you can use the following instructions to add, edit, or delete buildings from your school using your System Settings page.</p>

<li>User Email Attribute: Attribute used to send the user's email address to Schoology.</li>
<li>User Unique ID Attribute: Attribute used to send the user's Unique ID to Schoology.</li>
<ul>

<p>Once you've successfully established the link to your LDAP server, you can use the Test Login feature to test the LDAP login. The LDAP user you test must exist inside of your LDAP and Schoology (and must be matched by Username).</p>
<p><img title=""Image: /attachments/token/o4czvtm0llkmg0f/?name=LDAP+3.png"" src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/o4czvtm0llkmg0f/?name=LDAP+3.png"" alt=""LDAP_3.png"" width=""500"" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Once you enter the credentials, a popup window will appear to with a login success or failure message.</li>
<li>If you encounter any failures, click on the specific area for more information about the failure.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In the example below, you'll notice that the LDAP Server Connection was successfully established, but the login failed when trying to find the user in LDAP. In this case, the failure occurred because the username entered was not valid. This message most likely indicates that you have entered an incorrect Username RDN attribute or that the Username does not exist as an attribute in your LDAP server.</li>
</ul>
<p><img title=""Image: /attachments/token/wgqjyluqr3xbycg/?name=LDAP+4.png"" src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/wgqjyluqr3xbycg/?name=LDAP+4.png"" alt=""LDAP_4.png"" width=""500"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>LDAP User Lookup: This error likely indicates that you&nbsp; have entered an incorrect Username RDN attribute or that the username does not exist as an attribute in your LDAP server.</li>
<li>LDAP User Authentication failure: This error likely indicates that the password for this user does not match the password in your LDAP server.</li>
<li>Schoology User Identification: Failures most often occur here because you have an incorrect username in Schoology (the value that must match between Schoology and your LDAP) or because you have values in other attributes and Schoology that are trying to match on all values, rather than match on just the Username.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""contact"">Step 4: Contact your Client Success Specialist</h3>
<p>Once your test login succeeds, you can notify your&nbsp;Client Success Specialist to configure your custom domain to redirect to the Schoology LDAP login page.</p>",title:Article:201001173,"LDAP (Enterprise)"

<hr />
<h3>What is Remote Authentication?</h3>
<p>Remote Authentication allows a user to login to another website (e.g. school website) and then navigate to Schoology without having to login again. The Remote Authentication area allows you to configure your Single Sign-On (SSO) settings. By using this method of user authentication between your organization&rsquo;s directory (e.g. LDAP, AD, or OD) and Schoology, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage user credentials from a centralized location.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Login to Schoology from an outside location, e.g. your school website portal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""how_does_it_work"">How Does it Work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>The user goes to log in at Schoology by selecting a school with remote authentication enabled.</li>
<li>Schoology redirects the user to the Remote Authentication URL specified below (See Configure Remote Authentication).</li>
<li>The script running at the Remote Authentication URL will check to see fit he user is logged in.If the user is not logged in, they must first authenticate on the remote site.</li>
<li>Using the private token and information from your database, a hash value is created.</li>
<li>The user information and the hash are then sent to Schoology.</li>
<li>Schoology receives the data and generates a new hash.</li>
<li>If both hash values match, which ensures that the data was not modified or tapered with, the user is logged into Schoology.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""match_users"">Match Users</h3>
<p>Before you match users to your school directory, make sure you have created or imported users into your school account (See <a title=""Import: Comprehensive Guide to the Five Tabs (Enterprise)"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001013-Import-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Five-Tabs-Enterprise-"">Import </a>for more information).</p>
<ul>
<li>Either the <strong>Username</strong> or the <strong>User Unique ID</strong> field must match between your directory and Schoology in order to establish SSO.</li>
<li>We recommend using the following areas to match users:</li>
<ul>
<li>Match the Schoology User Unique ID to the User ID in your SIS.</li>
<li>Match the Schoology Username to the Username in your directory.</li>
</ul>
<li>The Schoology Username and Unique ID fields must be unique throughout your entire school.</li>
<ul>
<li>Unique ID- This ID is a unique identifier for each user (usually a School ID or SIS ID).&nbsp; It matches users with your data systems when you import/export.</li>
<li>Username- Users are required to have a username or email address.&nbsp; Usernames are unique to your school.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3 id=""configure_remote_authentication"">Configure Remote Authentication</h3>
<p>Once the information in <a title=""Edit Users: Comprehensive Guide to the Four Tabs (Enterprise)"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201000913-Edit-Users-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Four-Tabs-Enterprise-"">Edit Users</a> matches with your directory, you&rsquo;re ready to set up remote authentication.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Set up a Remote Authentication URL on your servers, from which your users will login using their directory credentials.&nbsp; This is the URL that Schoology will query when an anonymous user visits the login page and selects your school.</li>
<li>Script running at the Remote Authentication URL checks to see if the user has been authenticated against your directory</li>
<li>Using the Private Token and information from your database, a hash value will be created.</li>
<li>The user information and hash will be sent to Schoology.</li>
<li>Schoology will receive the data and generate a new hash.</li>
<li>If both hash values match, the user will be logged into Schoology and data will be updated or synced.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Click Enable Remote Authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><img title=""Image: /attachments/token/rfkk195zip4bg1h/?name=Remote+Auth+1.png"" src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/rfkk195zip4bg1h/?name=Remote+Auth+1.png"" alt=""Remote_Auth_1.png"" width=""550"" height=""54"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the Remote Authentication URL. This URL should exist on your servers, from which your users will login using their directory credentials.&nbsp; This is the URL that Schoology will query when an anonymous user visits the login page and selects your school.</li>
<li>Enter the Return URL, where users will be redirected when they logout.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><img title=""Image: /attachments/token/cjkymqno2lkqcoc/?name=Remote+Auth+2.png"" src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/cjkymqno2lkqcoc/?name=Remote+Auth+2.png"" alt=""Remote_Auth_2.png"" width=""550"" /></p>
<h3>Setup the server side script</h3>
<p>The page you specify for the Remote Authentication URL has the following two jobs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the user. If the user is not already authenticated on your system, log the user in.</li>
<li>Redirect the user to <a title=""Link: https://www.schoology.com/login/remote"" href=""https://www.schoology.com/login/remote"">https://www.schoology.com/login/remote</a> with the necessary parameters (See Parameters below).</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no direct communication between Schoology's servers and your servers. All communication is done through redirects and query strings. You can skip steps 1 and 2 of ""How does it work?"" above by linking directly to the Remote Authentication URL. Your script will be responsible for generating a current timestamp (i.e. less than five minutes old).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can download the following sample scripts that are pre-populated with your school ID and private token. To view and download these sample scripts and available parameters, navigate to the <a title=""System Settings: Integration (Enterprise)"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201000963-System-Settings-Integration-Enterprise-"">Integration </a>area of your Schoology account.</p>
<p>From the SSO script, users will be passed to Schoology with the necessary parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any parameter you include in the SSO script will update the user information in Schoology.</li>
<li>Required parameters are marked:</li>
<ul>
<li>timestamp</li>
<li>school_id</li>
<li>school_uid or username</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>Once the Remote Authentication URL is set up and the Server Script is up and running, email your Remote Authentication URL to your Client Success Specialist or Support Contact to complete the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must match either the school_uid or the username between Schoology and your directory.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Profile</strong><br />The permissions listed under Profile area determine which areas of the profile the role can adjust from their user accounts. We recommend that you examine each permission carefully to allow/prevent certain roles from changing their profile information. The following questions might provide guidance in setting appropriate permissions for your school:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I want <a title=""Link: https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201000983#faculty"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201000983#faculty"">non-faculty roles</a> (typically parents and students) to build their own user profiles?</li>
<li>Should users have the ability to change their email address?</li>
<li>Should users have the ability to change their profile pictures?</li>
<li>Do I have a way to encourage users to build their profile information?</li>
<li>Do I have a way to manage&nbsp;potential misuse of profile information?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Updates</strong><br />This area allows you to enable or disable users' ability to create updates in their own user profile, and their ability to comment on user profiles.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: Because user profiles are difficult to moderate for teachers or faculty members, the ability to create user updates is disabled for&nbsp;<a title=""Link: https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201000983#faculty"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201000983#faculty"">non-faculty</a> roles.

If you enable this feature for students, you should also consider asking teachers to check student blog posts on a regular basis.<br /><br /><strong>Messaging</strong><br />This area allows you to customize the way a role interacts with Schoology messages. We usually recommend that you disable the permission to Send Private Messages to Non-faculty for student and parent roles.<br /><br /><strong>Connections/Networking</strong><br />By default, only faculty roles may connect with other users on Schoology. We recommend that you leave connection settings enabled for only faculty roles to allow educators to build connection networks.<br />The ability to View Schoology Recommended Connections displays other educators in the Suggested area of the Home page (right column).

<h1>Overview</h1>
<hr />
<p>Schoology has developed a <a title=""SIS Integration (Enterprise)"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23888158-PowerSchool-Integration-Enterprise-"">Student Information System (SIS) integration platform</a> that enables Schoology to integrate with any SIS that provides a web services API. However, due to an issue with the API provided to us from PowerSchool, graded items and grades created in Schoology sometimes fail to reach the SIS in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>While PowerSchool is working on a resolution to the issue, we've built a feature in the PowerSchool app that allows teachers to launch the app from within a course, and sync graded items and grades from Schoology to PowerSchool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1) How does the System Admin install the app in courses?</h1>
<hr />
<p>From the App Center on the left menu of the Home page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the School Apps area at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Click on the Install/Remove button to the right of the PowerSchool app.</li>
<li>Select the box to install the app to All Courses. We also recommend that you enable the box to make the app available to Course Admins Only.</li>
<li>Submit the form to complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the form is saved, all courses in your schools mapped to PowerSchool will have the PowerSchool app in the left menu of the course profile!</p>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/jntmvt8k57eaynx/?name=PS+Installation+1.PNG"" alt=""PS_Installation_1.PNG"" width=""500"" /></p>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/yske61300ksxfv6/?name=PS+Installation+2.PNG"" alt=""PS_Installation_2.PNG"" width=""500"" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There currently isn't a way to select specific courses during this installation process. If there are some sections in Schoology not mapped to PowerSchool, the app will still be installed into the course. In this case, the teacher can simply elect not to use the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2) How do teachers configure the app?</h1>
<hr />
<p>When teachers launch the PowerSchool app from their course, they should first save settings in the Configuration tab of the app. This feature allows teachers to map their Schoology grading categories to one or more default PowerSchool grading categories: Homework, Quiz, Test, or Project. Depending on the grading categories in the course, teachers can map more than one Schoology grading category to a single PowerSchool grading category.</p>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/2zqfxnknhwwrlxy/?name=PS+Installation+3.PNG"" alt=""PS_Installation_3.PNG"" width=""500"" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the settings in place for the PowerSchool Teacher app, only Course Admin (teachers) may be able to launch the app from the course. System Admin cannot configure the app or sync graded items on behalf of the teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: If you'd like the overall grade in Schoology to match the overall grade in PowerSchool, please make sure that teachers configure the PowerSchool Teacher app:</p>
<ul>
<li>with the same number of categories in Schoology as in PowerSchool.</li>
<li>with the same weighted categories in Schoology as in PowerSchool.</li>
<li>with the ""<a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201120293-What-is-the-difference-between-a-grading-category-calculated-by-Total-Pts-and-a-grading-category-calculated-by-Percent-"">Calculated by</a>"" setting of grading categories set to ""Total pts.""</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>3) What information is&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;from Schoology to PowerSchool?</h1>
<hr />
<p>Once the configuration settings are saved, teachers can view the status of graded items and grades from the Sync Grades area of the app. The column on the left displays the Title of the graded item. The column in the middle displays the date the item had been successfully synced.</p>
<p>If a graded item or grade has not yet appeared in the PowerSchool Gradebook, you can navigate to this area of the app to manually re-send the information to PowerSchool by clicking on the Sync icon. The following information will be sent to PowerSchool:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the graded item.</li>
<li>The max number of points for the graded item.</li>
<li>The due-date for the graded item.</li>
<li>The grading category established by the System Admin, or by the teacher in the Configuration area of the app.</li>
<li>The raw score a student received on the graded item.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there has been an error in the sync, a red message icon will appear. Hovering over the icon will display a message that details the error.</p>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/hanpazdt6zn6iad/?name=PS+Installation+4.PNG"" alt=""PS_Installation_4.PNG"" width=""500"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4) What are the limitations to the Gradebook integration?</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>The PowerSchool API <strong>does not</strong> currently allow custom grading categories in the integration.</li>
<li>The PowerSchool API <strong>does not</strong> currently allow mapping of grading scales or attendance.</li>
<li>In cases where there are multiple gradebooks in a single PowerSchool course, Schoology <strong>does not</strong> update a particular gradebook within a course.</li>
<li>If an item is ungraded in Schoology, the item will <strong>not</strong> sync with PowerSchool.</li>

Article:201001083,"<h1>PowerSchool Integration Data Prep</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Data Prep area of the PowerSchool app should be completed prior to synchronization with PowerSchool if your school or district has existing users, courses, and sections in Schoology. If your school or district is new to Schoology, you do not need to complete this section.</p>
<p>The Data Prep area provides an export CSV file to help identify and map your school&rsquo;s student and faculty information between the two systems. This preparation allows Schoology to pull information from PowerSchool without creating extraneous or duplicate accounts. If user information does not match, synchronization issues may occur.</p>
<p>To ensure that student and faculty profiles are ready for Schoology/PowerSchool synchronization, follow this guide:</p>
<h3>Generate a User Mapping Report</h3>
<p>Under the Data Prep tab of the PowerSchool app, you can generate a report of user information in both Schoology and PowerSchool. This report displays users located in both Schoology and PowerSchool, users located only in Schoology, and users located only in PowerSchool.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the PowerSchool and Schoology Mapping Options.</li>
<ul>
<li>This selection designates how the report will attempt to map your users in both systems.</li>
</ul>
<li>Click Generate Report.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Understand the User Mapping Report</h3>
<p>Your report will be a CSV spreadsheet with Schoology information on the left and PowerSchool information on the right. This report matches user information in both systems to make sure that the integration works properly.</p>
<p>The Schoology Matching column may be different from the PowerSchool Matching column and should under no circumstances be modified. As long as the Integration-Mapping ID number is populated on the right, the user will successfully map between the two systems. This ID is used to link Schoology information with the corresponding PowerSchool information field. If you don&rsquo;t see an Integration-Mapping ID, you may manually input it in the correct column.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Integration-Mapping ID will always be the same as the PowerSchool Local ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three main scenarios of information exported in the user mapping report:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/ckffttsamhdgmvx/?name=Scenario+1.png"" alt=""Scenario_1.png"" width=""650"" /></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>Users in Schoology match directly with the users in PowerSchool based on the Mapping Option you chose before running the report. These rows will have the Integration Mapping-ID already populated. If all of your users match, you can synchronize Schoology and PowerSchool without issue.</p>
<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>There are user accounts in Schoology that do not have a corresponding account in PowerSchool. This scenario indicates that the user only exists in Schoology, or the Schoology mapping field does not match any PowerSchool mapping field.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the user currently only exists in Schoology, you can create their profile in PowerSchool and re-run the report to verify the match. Adding the user to PowerSchool will synchronize this user account with PowerSchool. Please note that there is no harm in having users only in Schoology, however, these users will not be synchronized with PowerSchool.</li>
<li>If the user currently exists in both Schoology and PowerSchool but their profiles are not matching, you can manually map the user information (e.g., Brandy Singh in Schoology is actually Marie B. Singh in PowerSchool). Simply input the user&rsquo;s PowerSchool Local ID into the Integration-Mapping ID field in the same row as their Schoology information, as displayed below:</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/7r33xalpjxybwfi/?name=scenario+2.png"" alt=""scenario_2.png"" width=""650"" /></p>
<h4>Scenario 3</h4>
<p>There are user accounts in PowerSchool that do not have a corresponding account in Schoology. This scenario indicates that the user only exists in PowerSchool, or the user&rsquo;s ID number or name does not match the corresponding information in Schoology.</p>
<ul>
<li>If users currently only exist in PowerSchool, the integration will automatically create these accounts in Schoology when the two systems are synchronized.</li>
<li>If the user currently exists in both PowerSchool and Schoology, you can manually map the user data using the information provided in Scenario 2 (above).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Save, Upload, and Update User Data</h3>
<p>Once you are finished mapping your Schoology and PowerSchool users, you should save the report to your machine or device. Check and double check the report, because you will not have the opportunity to check it again once you&rsquo;ve click the Update Users button.</p>
<p>From the PowerSchool app in Schoology under the Data Prep tab, upload your saved user data report into the file uploader and click the Update Users button.</p>
<p>By clicking Update Users, all of the Schoology profiles from your data report that match PowerSchool profiles will be given a new unique ID. This allows users to be connected with their corresponding PowerSchool profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because Schoology profiles receive a new unique ID after the Update Users button is clicked, running another mapping report would result in no matches, though everyone may be correctly mapped.</p>
<h3>Continue Setting Up PowerSchool Integration</h3>
<p>After updating user data, you are done with the Data Prep tab and are ready to move on to the Users, Courses, and Sections tabs, in that order.</p>",title:Article:201001083,"PowerSchool Data Preparation Tool (Enterprise)"

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br /></strong>Schoology has developed a Student Information System (SIS) integration platform that enables Schoology to integrate with any SIS that provides a web services API. The integration provides a seamless method for keeping Schoology populated with users, courses, school, and enrollment data. It also provides the ability for Schoology to transfer grade and assignment data into PowerSchool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1) What information is&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;from PowerSchool to Schoology?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br /></strong>Schoology will pull the following information from PowerSchool:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>School building information</li>
<li>Users (staff and student accounts)</li>
<li>Grading periods/terms</li>
<li>Courses, Sections, and&nbsp;Enrollments</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>&nbsp;All of the information listed&nbsp;above&nbsp;will be managed in PowerSchool<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and changes and updates will be&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;seamlessly to Schoology. However, it is important to note that in order to keep a consistent data model, any changes or updates made in Schoology will <strong>not</strong> be&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;to PowerSchool. You can add&nbsp;additional&nbsp;courses and users in Schoology that are not in PowerSchool without affecting your PowerSchool instance. This option is helpful if you want to do cross-school enrollments or if you have guest instructors, or if you have advisers&nbsp;that are not in PowerSchool.</p>

<h2><strong style=""font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">2) What information is&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;from Schoology to PowerSchool?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br /></strong>Schoology will push in&nbsp;real-time&nbsp;the following information to PowerSchool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade items (Assignments &amp; Assessments)</li>
<li>Grade updates (Changes to grades)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">Important Notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">Graded items created and updated in PowerSchool will not be&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;to Schoology in order to establish a master data source for all information. Schoology is the master for changes to grade data, while PowerSchool will remain the master for school, user, course, and enrollment data. To provide a&nbsp;consistent data model for your school, grade changes should be managed from Schoology.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">Information</span><span style=""font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">&nbsp;pushed from Schoology to PowerSchool is always real-time (Live) and cannot be scheduled. Graded items and grades can be manually synced to PowerSchool from the <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001153-PowerSchool-App-for-Teachers-Enterprise-"">PowerSchool Teacher App</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.4;"">3) How often is information updated between the systems?</strong></p>
<p>As a district, you may determine the frequency of updates between the two system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual (the system admin must manually sync the PowerSchool app in Schoology)</li>
<li>Scheduled (the syncing can occur on an hourly or daily schedule)</li>
<li>Live Sync Schoology Grades with PowerSchool sends graded items and grades from Schoology to PowerSchool.</li>

<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200614677/PowerSchool_Sync_Options.PNG"" alt="""" width=""701"" height=""408"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&nbsp;<strong>4)&nbsp;What is required to implement the PowerSchool App in Schoology?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The district will need to be operating <strong>version&nbsp;7.2 or higher</strong> of PowerSchool&nbsp;(Required)</li>
<li>The district will need to have <strong>SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Certificate</strong>&nbsp;with PowerSchool (Required)</li>
<li>The district should have<strong> Active Directory&nbsp;</strong><strong>synced&nbsp;</strong>with PowerSchool (optional, but highly suggested)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important to Note:</strong> Please contact your PowerSchool representative if you need assistance configuring the above items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><strong>5) How long does it take to get the integration working?&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2>
<p>While the technical integration between PowerSchool to Schoology may take as little as 15 minutes to establish,&nbsp;we perform data&nbsp;validation checks to ensure data&nbsp;accuracy between platforms. Please&nbsp;anticipate about 2 to 3 weeks to get the&nbsp;Powerschool&nbsp;integration fully running and operational. Schoology will work closely with the school district to ensure that all data is flowing properly and that the integration is stable. There are several different ways to configure PowerSchool, and Schoology wants to make sure that we sufficiently understand the proper data model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><strong><strong>6) What are the limitations to the PowerSchool integration?</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>PowerSchool <strong style=""font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">does not</strong>&nbsp;support the transfer of parent information via their API. This means that parents will have to be configured from within Schoology. Schoology will work closely with the district to understand how best to create parent accounts and maintain associations with students.</li>
<li>PowerSchool&nbsp;<strong style=""font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.45em;"">does not&nbsp;</strong>support the integration of&nbsp;attendance&nbsp;data via their API. This means that&nbsp;attendance&nbsp;taken in Schoology will not be transferred to PowerSchool. Schoology will work closely with the district to explain best approaches for handling this issue.</li>
<li>Grades pushed to PowerSchool from Schoology will not contain Schoology grading scales and custom categories because PowerSchool <strong>does not </strong>yet<strong>&nbsp;</strong>provide APIs that supports this workflow.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In cases where there are multiple gradebooks in a single PowerSchool course, Schoology <strong>does not</strong> update a particular gradebook within a course.</li>

Article:201001413,"<h1>What is Factor?</h1>
<hr />
<p>The factor for any graded item (assignments, tests/quizzes, discussions) multiplies the weight of the max pt value by the number input in the factor field.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Test A has a Max pts value of 10 and a Factor of 1.0,</p>
<p>and Test B has a Max pts value of 1 and a Factor of 10.0,</p>
<p>then Test B is weighted 10x more than Test A such that a perfect score on each item is essentially worth the same.</p>
<p>That is, if the student scores zero on one assignment and the max points for the other assignment, the calculated total percentage would be 50% for the two tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, if Assignment A has a Max pts value of 10 and a Factor of 1.0,</p>
<p>and Assignment B has a Max pts value of 10 and a Factor of 2.0,</p>
<p>then Assignment B is weighted 2x more than Assignment A.</p>
<p>If the student receives a zero on Assignment A and the max points for Assignment B, the calculated total average would be 67%. However, if the student receives the max points for Assignment A and a zero for Assignment B, the calculated total average would be 33%, because Assignment B is worth 2x Assignment A.</p>

<h1 id=""enable_question_tracking"">Enable Question Tracking</h1>
<hr />
<p>When creating a new Question Bank, you'll see the option to Enable Question Tracking. This feature allows you to track each question in the question bank after they are added to a test/quiz in a course.</p>
<p>Tracked questions are assigned an Associated Question ID, which means that the question is associated to a question in a locked question bank. This&nbsp;Associated Question ID is available when <a href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001473-How-do-I-use-Question-Banks-in-Schoology-#results"">exporting question stats</a>. When the question is used in multiple course tests/quizzes, the&nbsp;Associated Question ID for the question will remain the same in each test/quiz, allowing you to analyze information for test/quiz questions across courses.</p>
<p><img src=""/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200551367/Question_Tracking_1.PNG"" alt="""" width=""442"" height=""215"" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When a question bank has the Enable Question Tracking feature enabled, the question will become locked once you use it in at least one test/quiz. You will not be able to edit the question within the bank or within the test/quiz. This feature helps guarantee accurate tracking of questions used in tests/quizzes.</p>
<h3>When is Question Tracking Useful?</h3>
<p>Consider using tracked questions for the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>The school, department, or course would like to prevent teachers from changing test/quiz questions or answers after the question is used in a test.</li>
<li>The school, department, or course requires instructors to use a standard bank of questions for certain tests/quizzes.</li>
<li>The questions in certain tests/quizzes must be evaluated by <a href=""/hc/en-us/articles/201001473-How-do-I-use-Question-Banks-in-Schoology-#results"">exporting question results</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Question Tracking Best Practices &amp; Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Carefully check the questions in the question bank for any errors. Once the question is used in a test/quiz, it cannot be edited.</li>
<li>Advise instructors to use questions from locked question banks only after you've given them permission to use the questions.</li>
<li>If you notice a mistake in a locked question, advise the teacher to manually override the grade to the question in the test/quiz where the question is used. Then, create a new version of the question with the correct information.</li>
<li>If you've created a locked question bank by mistake, create a new question bank without the ""Enable Question Tracking"" feature enabled. Copy the questions from the locked bank into the new bank.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do I know when a question is being used?</h3>
<p>When at least one question is being used in a question bank with the Enable Question Tracking feature enabled, you'll see an icon that indicates that the question bank is now locked. When a question bank is locked, the Enable Question Tracking feature cannot be disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Locked Question Bank</strong></p>
<p><img src=""/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200457656/Question_Tracking_2.PNG"" alt="""" width=""534"" height=""161"" /></p>
<p>Instructors using a locked question in a test/quiz will also see an icon that indicates that the question is tracked. The content of these questions cannot be edited, but some other options of the test/quiz question may be available for adjustment (e.g. the ability to allow partial credit).</p>

Article:201001483,"<p>Schoology provides a great way for educators to connect with other educators, either within an organization or globally throughout Schoology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Why should I connect with other users?</h1>
<hr>
<p>Connecting with other users gives you two advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can adjust your<a title=""Personal Account Privacy (Teachers)"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201002043-Personal-Account-Privacy""> privacy settings</a> further to “Connections.”</li>
<li>&nbsp;You can more easily share information with connections.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Privacy Settings</h1>
<hr>
<p>Once you’ve made a connection with another user, you’ll notice an additional column in your <a title=""Personal Account Privacy (Instructor)"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201002043-Personal-Account-Privacy"">personal account settings</a> for Connections. This additional threshold allows you to tighten certain privacy settings so that only those with whom you’re connected have access to view the information in your personal profile.&nbsp; It also allows you to determine users with whom you may communicate through Schoology messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Share Information</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Personal Updates</h4>
<p>You can also easily update or share information with your connections by creating a personal update (click on your name, and write an update from your profile). Normally, users must navigate to your profile to view your personal updates. However, when you have a connection, personal updates of connected users will appear in the Recent Activity feed on your Home page.</p>
<h4>Resources</h4>
<p>Connections also allow you to easily share personal resource collections. When you navigate to your personal resources and click on a collection other than your Home collection, you’ll notice a Share button. This Share button allows you to share with faculty at your school, and with connected users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How do I find connections?</h1>
<hr>
<p>In general, faculty roles can connect with other faculty roles. For example, a teacher in one school can connect with another teacher. Since students and parents are not considered faculty, they cannot form connections with other users. In some cases, the System Administrator (Enterprise) at a school or organization may place some restrictions on the users with whom you may connect.</p>
<p>To connect with faculty at your school or organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your Home page.</li>
<li>Click on the People area on the left menu.</li>
<li>Click on the icon to connect with faculty at your school.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also see faculty information from the School profile:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the downfacing arrow in the upper right of the screen.</li>
<li>Click on your school or organization name.</li>
<li>Click on the Faculty area on the left menu.</li>
<li>Click on the icon to connect with other faculty at your school.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may also click into users' profiles by clicking on their name. If you're not yet connected with the user, you'll see the same icon to connect. In some cases, the school or organization may not allow the user account to connect with other users. In other cases, the user may not have verified their accounts on Schoology, which prevents their ability to connect with other users.</p>
<p>To search for a specific user:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the magnifying glass on the top menu.</li>
<li>Enter the user's name and press enter.</li>
<li>A list of users should appear in the search results. Look for the user with whom you'd like to connect.</li>
<li>Click on the Connect button to the right of the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>To search for users with common interests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Suggested Educators area on the right column of your Home page, or navigate to the My Connections tab in the People area on the left menu of the Home page.</li>
<li>If you haven't already made a connection, you'll see the option to Explore.</li>
<li>When you explore suggestion educators, Schoology automatically populates users with similar interests to yours. The more you build courses and content in Schoology, the better we'll be able to suggest users with common interests.</li>

Article:201001563,"<h1>Course Name vs. Section Name</h1>
<hr />
<p>Each course has a Course Name and a Section Name. This naming convention allows you to create multiple sections for the same course. For example:</p>
<p>Course Name: English 101</p>
<ul>
<li>Section Name: Section 1</li>
<li>Section Name: Section 2</li>
</ul>
<p>If your school uses class periods, you may also use a course/section structure like the following example:</p>
<p>Course Name: English 101</p>
<ul>
<li>Section Name: Period 1</li>
<li>Section Name: Period 2</li>
</ul>
<p><img title=""Image: /attachments/token/tj4ndhroq67cp5b/?name=Course+Creation+-+Instructor.PNG"" src=""https://support.schoology.com/attachments/token/tj4ndhroq67cp5b/?name=Course+Creation+-+Instructor.PNG"" alt=""Course_Creation_-_Instructor.PNG"" width=""500"" height=""229"" /></p>
<p>We recommend that you separate different class rosters into their own sections. If a group of students meet during Section 1, for example, you should consider creating another section for the group of students that meet at another time (Section 2).</p>
<p>This division of course sections allows you to customize <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001893-Courses-Course-Materials"">course materials</a>, <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001913-Courses-Attendance"">attendance</a>, and <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001903-Courses-Gradebook"">grades</a> for each group of students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Ideas for course section organization</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Use a new course section for each ""class,"" or roster of students.</li>
<li>Use a single course section for all classes, and use <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001403-How-do-I-use-the-Grading-Groups-feature-in-a-course-"">grading groups</a> to divide the course.</li>
<li>User a new course section for each school semester, or a single section for the entire school year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your class is uniquely yours, and you can create sections in ways that best suit your classroom needs as well as your school's policy. Consider the following questions and suggestions when creating sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do my courses use the same set of materials? If so, you should consider creating a ""master"" course in Resources and importing materials into each section.</li>
<li>Do some students in my course require individually assigned items? If so, having grading groups in addition to individually assigned items for a large number of students may become difficult to manage.</li>
<li>Are my students able to handle being in the same section with other students? Does my school allow this kind of classroom setup? If students are only permitted to view students in their own courses, having a combined course may not be the best option for you.</li>
<li>Does my school require me to grade on a quarter, semester, or full-year basis? Depending on the way your school structures their grading system, you might consider having a section for each semester so that you can have both quarter grades and semester grades.</li>
</ul>

<p>The External Tools feature allows Schoology users to interact with LTI-compliant resources and activities on other websites. Many websites provide interactive learning materials that are complementary to Schoology&rsquo;s own course materials and resources. External Tools allows you to connect with these tools and utilize them within your Course or Resources. When used in a course, external tools that support grade pass-back can send grading information to the Schoology gradebook.</p>
<h4>Adding External Tools in Courses</h4>
<p>External Tools can be added to a course just like any other type of course content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the&nbsp;Materials tab from the left menu&nbsp;in the Course Profile.</li>

<li>Optionally enter a Consumer Key, Shared Secret, or Custom Parameters.
<ul>
<li>Consumer Keys and Shared Secrets may be provided to you by the content provider that is hosting the external tool as an added level of security.</li>
<li>Custom Parameters may also be provided to you by the content providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable Grading will allow you to make an external tool visible in the Gradebook, and it will also support grade pass-back between the external tool and your course gradebook.</li>
<li>Click Create to complete.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Adding External Tools to Resources</h4>
<p>External tools can be added to resources just like any other type of course content. When external tools are added to resources, only the Title, URL, and custom parameters will be saved. The Consumer Key and Shared Secret must be added after the external tool resource has been imported into a course, or these can be automatically set if you have External Tool Providers set up on a course or school level.</p>
<h3 id=""external_tool_providers"">Adding External Tool Providers</h3>
<p>External Tool Providers can be added on a course or school level to automatically save Consumer Keys and Shared Secrets for specific domains or URLs.

<ul>
<li>Manual (choose this option unless you are linking to an XML file).
<ul>
<li>Match By allows you to select how you want the provider settings (consumer key, shared secret, privacy) to be automatically set for each external tool in the course.
<ul>
<li>Domain &ndash; Selecting this option means that when an external tool is added to a course, if the URL contains the domain of a provider, the provider settings will automatically be set for that item.</li>
<li>URL &ndash; Selecting this option means that when an external tool is added to a course, if you select the provider from the list, the URL field will automatically be populated.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Grading Scales and <a title=""How do I use rubrics?"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001513-How-do-I-use-Rubrics-"">Rubrics</a></h4>
<p>Create custom Grading Scales and Rubrics to grade your Assignments. Grading Scales map an alphanumeric value of your choice to a percentage grade (i.e. 0-100), and rubrics allow you to create a standard of performance for your students.</p>
<p>To add a new grading scale, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Gradebook in the left menu&nbsp;of the Course Profile.</li>
<li>Select Grade Setup&nbsp;directly underneath Gradebook.</li>

<li>Select the Scale option, and create either a Percentage or Point-based grading scale.</li>
<li>Fill out the form.
<ul>
<li>Enter a Scale Name to define the new Grading Scale.</li>
<li>For a percentage-based scale, set the Letter Grade that will be displayed to students in their grade reports. Letter grades must contain at least one letter.</li>
<ul>
<li>Set the percentage range for the grading scale.</li>
<li>If you enable the option to Use Average, Schoology calculates the average value for you.</li>
<li>If you enable the option to Only show letter grade, students will not see the percentage associated with the letter grade.</li>
</ul>
<li>For a point-based scale, enter a value and description for obtaining the value (e.g. 4= Exceeding Standard, 3= Meeting Standard...).</li>
<li>Use the Add Level button to add additional grade levels to this Scale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click Save Changes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you type the Letter Grade into the Gradebook instead of a numeric value, the system will use the Average Value as the percentage grade.</p>
<p>To add a rubric, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Gradebook in the left menu&nbsp;of the Course Profile.</li>
<li>Select Grade Setup&nbsp;directly underneath Gradebook.</li>

<li>Click Create to complete.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may create a rubric using either custom criteria or alignments, but you cannot create a rubric that contains both.</p>
<h4>Copy Settings</h4>
<p>If you have a new course to which you'd like to copy the same grade setup settings as a previous course, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the Course Profile of your previous course.</li>
<li>Select Gradebook in the left menu&nbsp;of the Course Profile.</li>
<li>Select Grade Setup&nbsp;directly underneath Gradebook.</li>

<p>My Resources, the title of your personal library, is a cloud-based storage space where you can save all your courses and materials. You can use this area to create resources as well. Anything saved in My Resources can be effortlessly copied and transferred into any or all of your courses. Once copied into a course, the material can be modified to fit specific classroom needs without altering the original copy.</p>
<h3>Home Collection</h3>
<p>A collection is like a container that stores courses, folders, files, and resources you may want to use in your account. You can think of a collection as a master folder that helps organize all of your work. For example, you can create a collection for each year, for each grading period, or for each course.</p>
<p>The Home collection is a personal collection of resources created and saved to your Resource Center. This collection exists by default, and it&rsquo;s only available to you. To share collections of resources with other faculty and connected users, you can create additional collections.</p>

<li>view all your learning objectives, the graded items they're tied to, and the range of scores your students have received on each.</li>
<li>assess how your students have performed on all assignments, discussions, tests, and quizzes aligned to any given learning objective.</li>
<li>understand individual student strengths and the learning objectives and assessment formats with which they struggle most.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature's high level of customization allows you to choose your grading scale and set achievement levels&mdash;i.e., the thresholds for&nbsp;missing, meeting, and exceeding expectations. You&nbsp;can even set how many times a student has to meet expectations to achieve mastery.</p>
<p>The various ways Student Mastery Reporting allows you to view student data provides a well rounded understanding of where students are in their learning, what they're struggling with, and what next steps can be taken to help them improve.</p>
<p>One great example of this is the individual student view that both instructors and students can see:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200586756/Mastery_II.JPG"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This view allows you to quickly assess which learning objectives any particular student needs help with. It also gives you an idea of whether they are struggling with a skill or simply do not perform well during certain kinds of assessments.</p>
<p>So whether you plan to go 100% standards-based grading or you simply want a more in-depth look at how your students are learning, Student Mastery Reporting will no doubt help you achieve your goals. At the very least, this feature will help you to improve your impact on students by knowing how to best tailor instruction.</p>

<h4>Editing Grades (Now with Auto-save!)</h4>
<p>Grades will automatically save in the Gradebook after you modify each grade cell. To edit grades for assignments and discussions, simply click on each cell and enter a grade. You can&nbsp;use the &ldquo;X&rdquo; character&nbsp;on your keyboard&nbsp;to give the student the max points&nbsp;for the assignment. For quick navigation, use the tab or arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>
<p>If the test/quiz is automatically graded, the grade should already appear in the cell. When you change any grade for a test/quiz, this change is considered a grade override, which is indicated by an orange color. Clicking on the lock icon will clear the override.</p>
<p>Using the dropdown menu located by each Assignment and Test/Quiz, you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit&mdash; Modifies the item Profile.</li>

<li>Set All Grades&mdash; Fills all of the grades with a single value.</li>
<li>View Statistics&mdash; Shows statistics for an Assignment or Test/Quiz.</li>
<li>Delete&mdash; Removes the Assignment, Test/Quiz, or Discussion from the course section.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all of these options are available for Test/Quizzes.</p>

<li>Check the box to Display to Student (optional).</li>
<li>Click Save Changes at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also&nbsp;place an Excused or Incomplete placeholder&nbsp;in a grade cell. These&nbsp;icons are marked in green and in red. They do not add value to the student's grades, but act as empty grade cells.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Comments and placeholders will appear in the student grade report (see the Graph Icon located to the right of the student's name).&nbsp;Comments&nbsp;for grading periods and the overall column&nbsp;will also appear on student report cards.</p>
<h4>Bulk Edit</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;Bulk Edit option in the Options button&nbsp;of the Gradebook allows you to view graded assignments, tests/quizzes, and discussions in a given course. You can edit or delete the following information for each:</p>

<h4>Import</h4>
<p>If the graded items in one course are the same as the graded items in another course, you may even import grades from an XLS/CSV file.</p>
<h4>Grading Groups</h4>
<p>We've also added a feature to grade members of your course in Grading Groups. This feature is best applied when your course already has members and graded items. To learn more about Grading Groups, find our article <a title=""Grading Groups"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001403-How-do-I-use-the-Grading-Groups-feature-in-a-course-"">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""grading_categories"">Grading Categories</h3>
<p>Grading Categories allow you to organize graded items in the course. At least one grading category is required in order for you to use the Gradebook. Common examples of categories include Classwork, Homework, or Quiz. There is no limit to the number of categories you can create, and each can be weighted according to your own definition.</p>

<li>Select Grade Setup directly underneath Gradebook.</li>
<li>Click the Add button to the right of Categories.</li>
<li>Enter a Category Name.</li>

<ul>
<li>Assignment 1: 200/200</li>
<li>Assignment 2: 100/100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Total Points&mdash;Assignment 1 is worth 2x more than Assignment 2.<br />Percent<strong>&mdash;</strong>Both Assignments are worth the same (100% each).</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Drop lowest to automatically drop the lowest grades in the course.</li>
<li>Click Create to complete.</li>

<h4>Weight Grading Categories</h4>
<p>After you have created at least one category, you can choose to Weight the Categories for your course by using the Weight Categories checkbox located by the Categories heading.</p>
<p>Enabling weighted categories will display a new Weight field next to each Category name. Inputting values into these fields allows you to adjust the weight for each category.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Weights are relative to each other. The actual percentage value of the Category can be seen next to the Weight field.</p>
<h4>Edit Grading Categories</h4>
<p>To make changes to an existing category, click on the category name. In the popup that appears, you may adjust:</p>
<ul>
<li>the category name.</li>
<li>the way the category is calculated.</li>
<li>the number of items you'd like to drop.</li>
<li>the weight of the category.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""grading_periods"">Grading Periods &amp; Final Weights</h3>
<p>The Grading Periods &amp; Final Weights area allows you to view all of the grading periods associated with your course, as well as the weighted percentages of each grading period. Depending on the settings in place at your school, you may be able to add or remove grading periods to your course.</p>

<li>If you don't see the ability to add grading periods to your course, you should contact a System Administrator (Enterprise), located in the <a title=""Where is the Help Center area?"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001423-Where-is-the-Help-Center-area-"">Help Center </a>area.</li>
<li>Click Save to complete.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Assignments, tests/quizzes, or graded discussions set as midterm/final will appear under the Grading Periods. These items are calculated as part of the student's overall grade, and you can view midterm/final graded items in the (Final Grades) dropdown option in Gradebook.</p>
<h4><a title=""How do I use Final Grade Settings in my course?"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001733-How-do-I-use-Final-Grade-Settings-in-my-course-"">Final Grade Settings</a></h4>

<li>If you enable the option to Use Average, Schoology calculates the average value for you.</li>
<li>If you enable the option to Only show letter grade, students will not see the percentage associated with the letter grade.</li>
</ul>
<li>For a point-based scale, enter a value and description for obtaining the value (e.g. 4= Exceeding Standard, 3= Meeting Standard...).</li>
<li>Use the Add Level button to add additional grade levels to this Scale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click Save Changes to complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>To add a rubric, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Gradebook in the left menu&nbsp;of the Course Profile.</li>
<li>Select Grade Setup&nbsp;directly underneath Gradebook.</li>

<li>To add additional columns to the scale, hover over the cell and click on the + icon that appears to the left and right of each cell.</li>
<li>To remove a row or column, hover over the cell and click on the x icon that appears in the upper right.</li>
<li>To reorder the rows, click on the double bars to the left and drag it to the appropriate location.</li>
<li>Use the menu items on the upper left to close or hide the rubric.</li>
<li>The Total Pts for the rubric will automatically adjust as you add rows and columns.</li>
</ul>
<li>To create a rubric using <a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201001453-What-are-Learning-Objectives-"">learning objectives</a> or standards, click on the Alignments link next to Criteria.</li>
<li>Click Create to complete.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may create a rubric using either custom criteria or alignments, but you cannot create a rubric that contains both.</p>

Article:201002223,"<h1>Dealing with “Insecure Content” errors (the “Load Anyway/Load Content” option)</h1>
<hr />
<p>Schoology now utilizes <a title=""SSL (HTTPS)"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Socket_Layer"">SSL (HTTPS)</a> on all pages throughout the site. This enables an extra layer of security, and a safe transmission of data from Schoology servers to your computer.</p>
<p>Since many users add custom embedded content from third-party sources (e.g. YouTube), it is possible for a user to embed content from a source that does not utilize SSL (HTTPS). While this practice is generally not harmful (assuming that you know the source you add content from is trusted), this does mean that most web browsers will now complain when trying to view “mixed content.”</p>
<p>For instance, if Chrome detects ""insecure content"" on your page, such as embedded videos using http instead of https, it will block the load of that content and present a Mixed-Content warning. Chrome will give you a message with an option to “Load Anyway,” as well as information to <a href=""https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1342714"">learn more</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using Chrome version 20 or earlier, you will see a yellow message at the top of your browser that reads “This page has insecure content,” followed by options to “Load Anyway” or “Don’t Load (Recommended).""</p>
<p><img src=""/attachments/token/pf1cjjlb3vqjbvv/?name=Insecure+Content+1.png"" alt=""Insecure_Content_1.png"" width=""400"" height=""37"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How to Proceed when Getting a Warning</h1>
<hr />
<p>If you trust that the content is safe, you can select the option to “Load Anyway” in the yellow message, or click on the gray shield icon and then select “Load Anyway.""</p>
<p>Once you have selected this option, you must then reload the page to get the content to load properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How to Prevent this Message from Appearing</h1>
<hr />
<p>When embedding content into Schoology, try to use sources that start with HTTPS, or use SSL. For instance, within YouTube, you have an option to “Use HTTPS” when choosing to embed (see below). While this option will vary from website to website, most websites today have a similar option.</p>

Article:201002273,"<h1>Issue</h1>
<hr>
<p>If you have the PowerSchool app installed to your course, and a graded item hasn't synced with PowerSchool, you may encounter an error message: You have multiple grading categories in PowerSchool that share the same name. Please navigate to our <a title=""This Current Article"" href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201002273-PowerSchool-Assignment-displays-a-Not-Synced-error-message-Enterprise-"">help center article</a> to resolve the issue with Pearson</p>
<p>This issue occurs when there are two grading categories in PowerSchool that share the same name when there should only be one grading category. That is, there had been an issue on PowerSchool's end that had allowed the creation of two grading categories with the same name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<hr>
<p>There are two paths, but either way, we recommend contacting PowerSchool about this issue so that it does not happen again.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">Contact PowerSchool and ask them to fix this issue for you. The issue is that somehow, there are two categories in the database for categories while only one shows up in the PowerSchool Gradebook. This is an issue because the API tries to create an assignment with the same category name and returns an error from the Oracle database that says ""Error - Got more than one result - resultSize=2.""</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">You can work with your PowerSchool admin to modify the category title and abbreviation in the database so that you do not have duplicates (you can also delete the duplicate, but we </span><strong style=""line-height: 1.4;"">do not</strong><span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">&nbsp;recommend deleting anything, since it's an irreversible action). The procedure to modify the duplicate category is listed below:</span></li>
</ul>
<ol><ol>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">First, go into the PowerTeacher Gradebook for each of the affected sections.</span></li>
<li>Once in the section, find the duplicate category and change both the name and the abbreviation to something that will stand out (e.g., append ""Active"").</li>
<li>Once you have appended, or added, something that will make the difference obvious, go into DDA (Direct Database Access) and find the category that is <strong style=""line-height: 1.4;"">not</strong> <strong style=""line-height: 1.4;"">the one you had altered</strong> (since the one you had altered is the active grading category in the Gradebook). Once you've found the duplicate (and unused) category (e.g., the one that does not have ""Active""), go ahead and modify that record to change both the Name and Abbreviation to something unique (e.g., append ""Unused"").</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>When you've reached a resolution, the graded items and grades should synchronize.</p>",title:Article:201002273,"PowerSchool Assignment displays a Not Synced error message (Enterprise)"

Article:201422866,"<p>Student Mastery Reporting allows instructors to view student achievement on any standard or learning objective that has been aligned to Assignments, Test/Quiz Questions, or Discussions within a course. This area contains multiple views that allow instructors to evaluate how students are learning and pinpoint students that may need additional attention.</p>
<p>To get started, you will need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standards aligned content</li>
<li>A preferred mastery grading scale (<a href=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/articles/201002143-Courses-Gradebook-Improved-#grade_setup"">Grade Setup &gt; Add &gt; Scale</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large""><strong>Using Student Mastery Reporting</strong></span></p>
<p>To access this area, instructors can go to any Course and click on the Mastery left menu option. The Mastery reporting area will display the overall grades that each student has for any alignments on graded course materials.</p>
<p>Each grade is color coded based on achievement thresholds and a star icon indicates which students have mastered the standard/learning objective.</p>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200586736/mastery_I.JPG"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>Student Mastery Reporting can be customized to accommodate most any standards-based grading model you choose. You can also view student achievement in a number of different ways. These ""views"" provide context and a more complete picture of student understanding.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large"">Student Achievement Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>The Student Achievement Overview shows you the achievement levels of your entire course at a glance. This is the pivot point for Mastery Reporting, enabling you to switch to the Learning Objectives view and quickly drill down to individual students and objectives. This view also shows:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether the student meets or exceeds your expectations or not via color coding</li>
<li>The Mastery Progress for each objective</li>
<li>The average student score</li>
<li>The number of graded materials associated with each objective</li>
<li>Whether or not the student has achieved the desired level of mastery</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200512808/Mastery_Reporting_II.JPG"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>From this Student Achievement Overview, you can easily customize your mastery settings using the Gear Icon at the top. You can&nbsp;choose your grading scale and set achievement levels&mdash;i.e., the thresholds for&nbsp;missing, meeting, and exceeding expectations. You&nbsp;can even set how many times a student has to meet expectations to achieve mastery.</p>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200512928/Mastery_Settings.JPG"" alt="""" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set Achievement Levels<br /></strong>This setting determines how student performance and mastery are evaluated</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meets Expectations</strong> - Sets the minimum score for the light green color</li>
<li><strong>Exceeds Expectations</strong> - Sets the minimum score for the dark green color</li>
<li><strong>Mastery</strong> - Sets the requirements for students to achieve mastery on a standard/learning objective</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Grade Overall Learning Objectives<br /></strong>This setting determines how the overall grades are calculated for each standard/learning objective</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average</strong> - Displays the average score from all grades for that particular alignment</li>
<li><strong>Highest Score</strong> - Displays the highest of all grades for that particular alignment</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Display Achievement Levels as<br /></strong>This setting determines how the grades are displayed for each standard/learning objective by letting you select a grading scale</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what standards-based model best suits your courses, we recommend reading&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.marzanoresearch.com/formative-assessment-standards-based-grading"" target=""_blank"">Formative Assessment &amp; Standards-Based Grading</a>&nbsp;by Robert J. Marzano. Student Mastery Reporting was designed to enable all the grading systems discussed in his book.</p>
<p><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large""><strong>How Are Mastery Scores Calculated?</strong></span></p>
<p>Scores for each standard/learning objective are calculated using only the grades that are given for that specific alignment. Since Assignments, Test/Quiz Questions, and Discussions can all be graded, Schoology will calculate mastery scores specific to each type of content to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you choose one grading scale for Student Mastery Reporting, so each graded item, whether graded by a rubric, percentage, or point-based scale will be calculated to fit your chosen mastery scale.</p>
<table style=""height: 54px; vertical-align: top; width: 568px;"" border=""1"" width=""568"">

<td><strong>Type of Course Material</strong></td>

<p><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large""><strong>View Achievement by Learning Objective</strong></span></p>
<p>By toggling to the Learning Objectives view at the top of your page, you can see the range of scores your students received for each graded material organized by learning objective.</p>
<p>The box-plot square represents the average score and the lines extend to the highest and lowest scores. Notice that you can also customize your Mastery Settings from this view.</p>
<p><img src=""https://support.schoology.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200475116/Mastery_III.JPG"" alt="""" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: large;"">View Achievement by Individual Student</strong></p>
<p>You can view an individual student's mastery report by clicking on the student names within the main view of Mastery. This view will show you (and your student) a list of all standards/learning objectives with their overall scores for each.</p>
<p>Color-coded graphs enable you to see of all the items that are aligned to each objective and how the student scored for each item. The items in the graph are displayed in the order in which they appear in the course folder structure, letting you track student performance as they progress through the course.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large"">Viewing Achievement by Individual Learning Objective</span></strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you can view student achievement based on a single learning objective by clicking on the one you want at the top of the Achievement Overview page. This view provides the same at-a-glance qualities of the Overview, but helps you better understand how each student performed on each assessment.</p>

Article:201003713,"<h1>This article explains what to expect when using the Clever app to provision data from a Student Information System to Schoology.&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article will address the following questions:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>How does Clever work?</li>
<li>What information is&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;from Clever to Schoology?</li>
<li>What information is&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;from Schoology to Clever?</li>
<li>How often is information sent to Schoology?</li>
<li>What is required to implement the Clever App in Schoology?</li>
<li>How long does it take to get the integration working?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What are the limitations to the Clever integration?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Schoology has developed a Student Information System (SIS) integration platform that enables Schoology to integrate with any SIS that provides a web services API. The integration provides a seamless method for keeping Schoology populated with users, courses, school, and enrollment data. Schoology has integrated with Clever (<a title=""www.getclever.com"" href=""http://www.getclever.com"">www.getclever.com</a>) to enable&nbsp;provisioning&nbsp;from over 50+ student information systems. The integration replaces the need for districts to&nbsp;manually maintain data in Schoology via uploads. Clever provides automated provisioning of school information, users, grading periods/terms, courses, sections, and enrollments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1) How does the Clever work?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The district should visit<a style=""font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.4;"" title="" https://getclever.com/schools/signup/schoology"" href=""%20https://getclever.com/schools/signup/schoology"">&nbsp;https://getclever.com/schools/signup/schoology</a>&nbsp;to sign up for Clever.</li>
<li>For complete instructions please view Clever's documentation here - <a title=""Click Here"" href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/cv0qqhqx1iaibg8/clever-support-reference-guide.pdf"">click here</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>2) What information is&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;from Clever to Schoology?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br /></strong>Schoology will pull the following information from PowerSchool:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>School building information</li>
<li>Users (staff and student accounts)</li>
<li>Grading periods/terms</li>
<li>Courses, Sections, and&nbsp;Enrollments</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>&nbsp;All of the information listed above will be managed in the districts Student Information System<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and changes and updates will be&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;seamlessly to Schoology via Clever. However it is important to note that any changes or updates made in Schoology will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;back to your Student Information System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>3. What information is&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;from Schoology to Clever?</span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Step 1: Setting Up The Framework&nbsp;</h1>
<hr />
<h4 class=""MainText"">Roles, Permissions, Privacy</h4>
<p class=""MainText"">Schoology is a system based on roles and permissions. Every user inside of Schoology is associated with a specific role, and the System Administrator can customize the permissions associated with each role in order to establish what each role can and cannot do.</p>
<h4 class=""MainText"">Roles</h4>
<p class=""MainText"">Roles categorize the type of account for each user in the system. By default, there are four (4) basic roles for your school: Student, Instructor, Administrator, Parent. As a System Administrator, you can create new roles at any time.</p>
<p>Roles allow you to use the Permissions area to turn on/off any feature for a select category of users. For example, if you want to disable certain features for a small subset of users, you can create a role called &ldquo;Limited Student&rdquo; and adjust the permissions to limit their ability to post content on Schoology.</p>
<p class=""MainText"">Navigate to the Roles area of Schoology by clicking&nbsp;<a title=""Schoology Roles (Enterprise)"" href=""http://www.schoology.com/users/manage/roles"">here</a>.&nbsp; Use our <a title=""Edit Users: Roles (Enterprise)"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23210443-Edit-Users-Roles"">Roles Guide</a> will help you get familiar with this area.</p>
<h4 class=""MainText"">Permissions</h4>
<p class=""MainText"">Navigate to the <a title=""Schoology Permissions (Enterprise)"" href=""http://www.schoology.com/users/manage/permissions"">Permissions</a> area of Schoology to research the categories of permissions available for each role.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find contact information for further assistance in our <a title=""Edit Users: Permissions (Enterprise)"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23218458-Edit-Users-Permissions"">Permissions Guide</a>.</p>
<h4 class=""MainText"">Privacy</h4>
<p class=""MainText"">Navigate to the <a title=""Schoology Privacy Overrides (Enterprise)"" href=""http://www.schoology.com/system_settings/privacy"">Privacy</a> area of Schoology to place privacy thresholds at your school or organization. Our <a title=""System Settings: Privacy Overrides (Enterprise)"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23196601-System-Settings-Privacy-Overrides"">Privacy Overrides Guide</a> can help you understand each setting.</p>
<p class=""MainText"">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=""MainText""><strong>Step 2: Creating and Managing Users</strong></h2>
<p class=""MainText"">To create and manage user information, navigate to the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Edit Users<strong>&nbsp;</strong>area of your Schoology admin profile. The tabs along the top allow you to access different kinds of information and perform actions associated with this information.</p>
<p class=""MainText"">Below are a few key things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can login using a Username, an Email Address, or either.</li>
<li>Unique IDs (used to match users with other systems like an SIS) must be unique throughout your entire Schoology system.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MainText"">Our <a title=""Edit Users: Comprehensive Guide to the Four Tabs (Enterprise)"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23185242-Edit-Users-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Four-Tabs-Enterprise-"">Edit Users Guide</a> can help you to manage your users effectively.</p>
<h3 class=""MainText"">Create Users</h3>
<p class=""MainText"">Choose one of four method options to create and manage your users: SSO, Google, Import or Access Codes.</p>
<h4>Option 1: Single Sign-On (SSO)</h4>
<p>You can set up Single Sign-On between your organization&rsquo;s directory (e.g. LDAP, AD, or OD) and Schoology. This configuration will allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage user credentials from a centralized location</li>
<li>Login to Schoology from an outside area (e.g. your website portal)</li>
</ul>
<p>To set up SSO, navigate to your <a title=""Schoology Remote Authentication (Enterprise)"" href=""http://www.schoology.com/system_settings/integration/remote_auth"">Schoology Remote Authentication Settings</a>. Our <a title=""System Settings: Integration (Enterprise)"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23199791-System-Settings-Integration-Enterprise-"">Remote Authentication Guide </a>can help you through this process.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class=""MainText"">Option 2: Google Provisioning:</h4>
<p class=""MainText"">You can provision your users over from Google Apps for Education. To provision users from Google accounts, navigate to your <a title=""Schoology External Account Management (Enterprise)"" href=""http://www.schoology.com/system_settings/integration/external_accounts"">Schoology External Account Management Settings</a>. Our <a title=""System Settings: Integration (Enterprise)"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23199791-System-Settings-Integration"">External Account Management Guide</a> can help you through this process.</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot provision users into a specific school.&nbsp; Instead, all users will be provisioned into the district account, where you may move them into the appropriate school buildings using a CSV or XLS import file.</li>
<li>Once your Google accounts are in Schoology, their Unique ID will be the prefix of their email (e.g. <a href=""mailto:jsmith@gmail.com"">jsmith@gmail.com</a> will be jsmith).</li>
<li>Note: Since the Unique ID must be the prefix of the Google email, this may cause conflicts when exporting out of your SIS and into Schoology (e.g. course enrollment imports).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Option 3: Import</h4>
<p>You can provision your users using a CSV or XLS import file, perhaps exported from your SIS or another database. To import users with a CSV or XLS, navigate to your <a title=""Schoology Import (Enterprise)"" href=""http://www.schoology.com/import"">Schoology Import Page</a>. Our <a title="" Import: Comprehensive Guide to the Four Tabs (Enterprise) "" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23214533-Import-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Four-Tabs"">User Import Guide</a> can help you through this process.</p>
<h4 class=""MainText"">Option 4: Access Codes</h4>
<p class=""MainText"">Instead of importing users into your system, you can allow users to use access codes to register for their Schoology accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>To allow teachers to register by access code, navigate to your <a title=""Schoology System Settings (Enterprise)"" href=""http://www.schoology.com/system_settings"">Schoology System Settings</a>. Our <a title="" System Settings: Schools (Enterprise) "" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23193012-System-Settings"">System Settings Guide</a> can help you with this process.</li>
<li>Teachers can also distribute access codes to individual students, which allows students to register their accounts. The <a title=""Add Members to Courses"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23229467-Courses-Add-Members-to-Courses"">Access Code portion of our Instructor Guide</a> details this process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>We recommend importing your users into the system so that their accounts are associated with a Unique ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Step 3: Course Creation</strong></h1>
<hr />
<h3 class=""MainTextCxSpFirst"">Set up Grading Periods</h3>
<p class=""MainTextCxSpLast"">You must set up your grading periods to establish the length of your courses. To set up your grading periods, navigate to the Grade Settings tab in your <a href=""http://www.schoology.com/system_settings/periods""><strong>Schoology System Settings</strong></a>. Our <a href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23219028-System-Settings-Grade-Settings-Enterprise-""><strong>Grade Settings Guide</strong></a> can help you through this process.</p>
<h3 class=""MainText"">Create Courses</h3>
<p class=""MainText"">Choose one of two methods for course creation: ImportorManual. We recommend that you use the Import option, because this option allows you to enroll the teachers and students yourself.</p>
<h4 class=""MainTextCxSpMiddle"">Option 1: Import Courses&nbsp;</h4>
<p class=""MainText"">This option allows you to import course information using a CSV or XLS file. To import course information, navigate to the courses tab&nbsp;in your Schoology Import area. Our <a title="" Import: Comprehensive Guide to the Four Tabs (Enterprise) "" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23214533-Import-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Four-Tabs"">Import Courses Guide</a> can help you in this process.</p>
<h4 class=""MainText"">Option 2: Manually Create Courses</h4>
<p class=""MainText"">Manually creating courses in your Schoology system is an easy three-step process. Your faculty can create their own courses as needed. The <a title=""Create Courses"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23229457-Courses-Create-Courses"">Course Creation portion of our Instructor Guide</a> can help you and your faculty in this process.</p>
<p class=""MainText"">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class=""MainText""><strong>Step 4: Course Enrollment&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p class=""MainText"">Choose one of two methods: Import or Manual.</p>
<h4 class=""MainText"">Option 1: Import</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use this area of Schoology to Import<strong>:</strong> <a href=""http://www.schoology.com/import/course_enrollments"">http://www.schoology.com/import/course_enrollments</a></li>
<li>Find instructions: <a href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23214533-Import-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Four-Tabs"">https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23214533-Import-Comprehensive-Guide-to-the-Four-Tabs</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Option 2: Manually Create Courses</h4>
<ul>
<li>Users can join courses by entering an access code, or teachers can use the Add Members button to manually add students.</li>
<li>Find instructions:&nbsp;<a href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23229467-Courses-Add-Members-to-Courses"">https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23229467-Courses-Add-Members-to-Courses</a></li>
</ul>
<p class=""MainText""><strong>After you complete this fourth step, the majority of your framework is complete!</strong></p>
<p class=""MainText"">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class=""MainText"">Site Survey</h1>
<hr />
<p class=""MainText"">We recommend performing the following tasks for optimal performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check <a title=""System Requirements"" href=""https://schoology.zendesk.com/entries/23197292-System-Requirements"">System Requirements.</a></li>
<li>Run a <a title=""Speed Test"" href=""http://www.speedtest.net/"">speed test</a> during the school or work day.</li>
<li>Add Schoology to your whitelist.</li>
<li>Check your firewall settings for blocks against common URLs.</li>
<li>Open ports 443, 8080, and 80.</li>
<li>Send us your school or organization&rsquo;s IP address to add to our whitelist.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MainText"">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class=""MainText"">After Set Up: Product Training</h1>
<hr />
<p class=""MainText"">During implementation, your Client Success Specialist will support you in training a small group of Schoology power users and project leaders. This group will be given the opportunity to review key Schoology features in-depth, discuss best practices, and utilize support and training materials with their Client Success Specialist.</p>
<p class=""MainText"">In addition to the product training services provided in the initial consultation, Schoology also offers optional train-the-trainer sessions, which may be purchased by contacting your sales representative.</p>
<p class=""MainText""><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<h1 class=""MainText"">Ongoing Support</h1>
<hr />
<p class=""MainText"">Schoology offers two levels of support:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first level is community-based support, which is available to all administrators and instructors via a &ldquo;Feedback/Support&rdquo; button located in the dropdown menu in the upper right corner of Schoology. Community support is helpful for finding frequently asked questions and for posting new ideas. As part of your support management practices, you may choose to recommend this level of support for teachers and other staff or faculty at your school.</li>
<li>The second level is dedicated support. As an enterprise client you have access to our dedicated support. You may choose up to three (3) dedicated support contacts from your school/district, whose role is to relay any questions, concerns or ideas to the Schoology team. These three (3) main support contacts can contact Schoology by:</li>
